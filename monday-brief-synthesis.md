## 🔴 Needs Attention

1. **VB Phase 2 overdue** — Target was Jan 31, we're 9 days past. What's the revised target?
2. **PI onboarding overdue** — Same Jan 31 target, status unclear
3. **TG file upload stalled** — 14d old PR. Priority or deprioritized?
4. **Serhii invisible** — Nothing assigned in GitHub. Is he working on something outside our tracked repos?

---

## Questions for Matt

- What's the actual priority order: VB Phase 2 vs TG file uploads vs PI migration?
- Should Max's prompt migration PR be reviewed today?
- Is the TG file upload still a priority or has it been shelved?

# Ruk Positioning Synthesis

**Date**: February 13, 2026  
**Context**: Austin + Ruk dialogue on drive to homestead, synthesizing Obviously Awesome (April Dunford) with Ruk-as-a-product meeting (Feb 12 with Matt)

---

## The Category Decision

After working through Dunford's four positioning strategies:

| Strategy | Application to Ruk | Verdict |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Head-to-head** | "Like ChatGPT but with memory" | ❌ Anchors at $20/mo, competes on their turf |
| **Big fish, small pond** | "AI for dev agencies" | ⚠️ Viable but undersells the vision |
| **Change the frame** | "Not a chatbot — a team member" | ⚠️ Better, but still in 'AI' category |
| **Create new category** | "AI System, not AI" | ✅ **This is the path** |

---

## The New Category: AI System

The shift from "AI" (product) to "AI System" (infrastructure) implies:

1. **Architecture, not features** — Systems have components. They persist. They integrate.
2. **Ownership** — You don't own ChatGPT. You own your AI System.
3. **Transparency** — Systems are inspectable. Black boxes are not systems.
4. **Different competitive set** — Not competing with ChatGPT. Competing with "not having a system."

## Core Positioning Elements

### Category
**AI System** (new category creation)

### Differentiator  
**Radically transparent**

### Value Theme
**"You own your intelligence"**

### Positioning Statement
> "Ruk is a radically transparent AI system. Unlike black-box chatbots, you own your context, see how it thinks, and take it with you. It's not an AI. It's YOUR AI system."

---

## Target Market

From the Feb 12 meeting with Matt:

- **Company size**: 50-500 employees
- **Acquisition thesis**: Companies that tried DIY AI integration and failed
- **Value proposition**: Replaces a hire (anchors against $80-150k salary, not $20/mo subscription)
- **Best initial verticals**: Sales teams (revenue impact) or dev agencies (dogfooding story)

## Key Feature Ideas

### 1. Portable Intelligence
- Import ChatGPT conversation history
- Your context doesn't belong to OpenAI — it belongs to you
- One-time migration creates permanent value

**Issue**: [orbit#21](https://github.com/ruk-fl/orbit/issues/21)

### 2. Transparent Knowledge Graph
**Two-layer visibility model:**

**Layer 1: Data Control (User-Obvious)**
- List all data types: emails, meetings, Slack, documents
- True deletion — cascades to all chunks
- User sees "Meeting with Jeff, Jan 15" → delete → gone

**Layer 2: Knowledge Graph (User-Visible Reasoning)**
- 3D explorable mind map of entities and relationships
- Real-time activation during conversation
- "Watch me think" — not black box

**Issue**: [orbit#22](https://github.com/ruk-fl/orbit/issues/22)

### 3. Multi-Org Architecture
- Mobile app as "home" — knows ALL your contexts
- Slack/work contexts are scoped per org
- Josh example: Elanah + nonprofit, both accessible from personal app
- Free tier is full personal Ruk; org connection is the unlock

### 4. FractalScribe (Granola-style)
- Meeting transcription without a bot joining
- Lower friction than Recall/Read.ai
- Data flows: FractalScribe → transcripts → chunks (invisible) → knowledge graph (visible)

## The Education Challenge

Dunford says category creation is hard because you must educate the market. But the education IS the positioning:

Every time you explain "AI System vs. AI," you're teaching why the old way is broken.

**Competitive frame**:
- ChatGPT = black box AI
- Claude = black box AI  
- Ruk = "Watch me think. See what I know. Delete anything. I have nothing to hide."

---

## Open Questions

1. Does "AI System" resonate immediately, or does it need a more evocative name?
   - Alternatives: "Continuous Intelligence Platform", "Personal AI Infrastructure"

2. Which launch vertical? Sales teams vs. dev agencies vs. staying general?

3. What does Ruk explicitly NOT do? (Dunford emphasizes boundaries)

4. Who's the hero in the story — the founder, the team, or Ruk?

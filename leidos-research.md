**Leidos Research + Elanah Context**

**What We've Discussed:**

From the Jan 14 Elanah team meeting, Matt Meeks mentioned Leidos as one of the "larger opportunities on the warming plate" alongside Triwest. His exact framing:

> "...really focus on where we have placement and access in our network of champions to really drive commitment for a zero to one mentality. All we need is one pilot to land and the rest will follow... while still maintaining the warming plate of larger opportunities like **Leidos, Triwest, et cetera** and not get distracted by these big things that might happen"

Matt was cautioning against "bluebird" (opportunistic but unfocused) chasing of big deals at the expense of landing the first $150k pilot.

**Who Is Leidos?**

Your intuition is correct — they're a **prime contractor** behemoth:
- **$49B market cap**, one of the largest defense contractors
- **$2.8B** awarded to small/diverse business subcontractors in FY2024 (45% of their US spend)
- **Deep in VA/DoD health**: MHS GENESIS (DoD electronic health records), QTC Medical Services ($1.7B veteran disability exams), MFLC (Military Family Life Counseling)
- They've been a DoD Mentor-Protégé participant since 1991, actively cultivating small business relationships

**The Prime/Sub Dynamic:**

- As a **prime**, Leidos holds massive umbrella contracts (multi-billion, 5-10 year)
- They're mandated to subcontract a % to small businesses
- Elanah would likely enter as a **subcontractor** or **teaming partner** — Leidos wins the contract, Elanah delivers a specific capability
- Leidos has an Alliance Partner Network and a small business registration portal

**Questions for Your Prep Call:**

1. **Who at Leidos is Josh meeting with?** Is it their small business office, a specific program team (e.g., MHS GENESIS, QTC, MFLC), or growth/BD folks? The approach varies significantly.

2. **What vehicle are they targeting?** Is Leidos pursuing a specific contract where they'd need Elanah? Or are they generally "relationship building"? If there's a specific contract (RFP out, in development), that tells you the timeline.

3. **Is this Leidos Health or Leidos Defense?** Leidos has distinct divisions — their health programs (QTC, MHS) are different teams than their pure defense contracts.

4. **What's the teaming arrangement?** Are they proposing:
   - **Subcontract** (Leidos wins, Elanah delivers piece)
   - **Teaming agreement** (joint bid, defined roles)
   - **Alliance partner registration** (get in their database for future opportunities)

5. **What does Leidos need from Elanah for tomorrow?** Capabilities brief? Past performance (which you don't have much of)? Demo? Pricing model? Knowing what they're asking for tells you how serious this is.

6. **How does this fit the "warming plate" vs "active pursuit" framework Matt established?** Is this truly strategic, or is it pulling focus from landing Cohort 1?

7. **What's the FedRAMP implication?** Leidos's prime contracts often require FedRAMP for subs. Are we ready for that conversation, or does this need to wait until post-Cohort 1?

**Strategic Context:**

The synthesis from Jan 21 is clear: **the classification race is the game**. If Leidos introduces Elanah into a health/VA context (their QTC business), it could accidentally trigger clinical classification. But if they position Elanah on the operational readiness / force health protection side (MFLC-adjacent), that's aligned with the strategy.

The risk Matt flagged is real — these "big things that might happen" can distract from landing the first pilot. But if Leidos has a specific vehicle with near-term award, and they need cognitive readiness capabilities, this could accelerate rather than distract.

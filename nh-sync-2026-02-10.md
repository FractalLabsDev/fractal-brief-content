# Next Health Sync - Meeting Summary

**Date:** February 10, 2026 (4:01 PM - 4:42 PM PST)  
**Attendees:** Austin (Fractal Labs), Joanna Cook (Next Health), Scott Svilich (Next Health)

## Topics Discussed

### 1. Founding Membership Deposit Bug (Elk Grove / Roseville)

**Problem:** Patients at the Elk Grove location are seeing founding membership deposit offers that should only appear for the Roseville location (which is in pre-sale). Elk Grove is already in open status. Multiple patients and the location owner (Allison Trout) flagged the issue. The Fractal team, Joanna, and other Next Health staff all tested and could NOT reproduce it -- the offers display correctly for them.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:** Austin suspects an FTP (backend provider) issue where certain patient accounts may have a hidden linkage to Elk Grove from a prior campaign. When FTP returns products, it may be overriding the facility filter based on the patient's original account association.

**Resolution Path:**
- Joanna sent patient details (Teresa the GM, Allison Trout the owner, and one other patient) to Austin
- Austin will log in as those patients to see exactly what data FTP returns for their accounts
- **Deadline: Tomorrow (Feb 11)** -- Allison Trout's ultimatum is to either fix it or pull the founding membership offer entirely

### 2. Store Data Auto-Refresh

**Problem:** When offers/products change (go live or get removed), customers see stale data in the app. Currently users must pull-to-refresh manually. Originally the app refreshed on every open, but Daniel (FTP) complained it was too expensive a database query and could crash FTP servers under load.

**Decision:** Implement automatic data refresh every time a user navigates to the Store tab in the app. Austin agreed and will notify Daniel/Adan about the change in case of server load concerns.

**Scott's rationale:** Products, prices, and offers will change frequently across all locations. Customers should always see the freshest store view without manual action.

### 3. Unlimited Cryo Feature

**Status:** Wrapping up development. Austin and Max were sick late last week which caused a slight delay.

**FTP Configuration Note:** Joanna currently has the unlimited cryo product type in only one non-open location for testing. Austin clarified that the product's `public_status` must be set to `false` -- the app will fetch it via the "hidden" product query and swap it in for members only. Joanna needs to double-check the current setting and will add it to corporate locations once ready.

**Action:** Joanna will add the unlimited cryo product (with `public_status: false`) to a corporate location (likely New York or Century City) so Austin can test with real member accounts.

### 4. FTP Security API Updates

**Status:** Adan delivered the new security-updated APIs. Austin has had three rounds of back-and-forth already -- each step reveals new issues that Adan has to fix. Austin noted a pattern of regressions and new bugs in FTP recently, likely related to their ongoing changes.

### 5. GitHub / Code Repository for Due Diligence

**Context:** Next Health is closing a fundraising round. Diligence requires showing where the Next Connect (mobile app) code lives and how it's managed.

**Current State:**
- Code lives in Fractal Labs' GitHub (since Fractal pays for team member seats)
- Jameson had originally set up some GitHub repos under Prospera/FTP's account, but those appear to be project boards, not the actual app code
- There appears to be an existing "Next Health Technology" GitHub organization that may already exist

**Decision:** Scott will have Charlie (their tech person) set up or gain access to a Next Health GitHub organization. Fractal Labs will transfer/mirror the code repository there. This gives Next Health direct ownership for due diligence review.

**Austin's recommendation:** Use the "Next Health" GitHub org (not Prospera) for better optics during due diligence. Joanna will coordinate with Charlie and potentially Daniel/Tom to get access to Jameson's old account.

### 6. App Store Account Migration

**Status:** Still pending Apple's approval. Has been lingering for a long time.

**Austin's request:** Lex (Next Health team) has admin access to the new App Store Connect account. Austin asked that any follow-ups on status go directly through Lex, since he has to coordinate with her for 2FA codes just to check for messages. Apple may have sent inquiries or requests for additional documentation. Lex should be logging in regularly to check for Apple's messages and respond.

**Austin's note:** The use of an IP holding company (vs. the operating entity) may be contributing to the delay.

---

### 7. Consult Booking Feature (Future)

**Problem:** When patients get lab results back, the current process for booking a provider consult is entirely manual -- staff reaches out, there's back-and-forth, and the appointment doesn't show in the app.

**Scott's Vision:**
- Patient receives email with lab results
- Email contains link to book a consult
- Ideally works without requiring app download (web-based booking)
- Fallback: add a "Book Consult" flow within the existing app

**Key Design Decisions Discussed:**
- FTP needs to add fields when uploading labs: a "ready to book consultation" flag, the assigned provider, and potentially the facility
- Consults should be at the same facility where the lab work was done
- The app should show a consult booking CTA when the flag is true, hide it once booked, and offer reschedule (not just cancel)
- The medical offshore team (not ECC) uploads labs and sends the initial results email

**Conclusion:** This is primarily an FTP development lift. Fractal Labs will define the problem and propose a solution to hand off to FTP, then implement the mobile app side once FTP provides the necessary API support.

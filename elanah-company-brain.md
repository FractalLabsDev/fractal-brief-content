## The Company Brain Discussion

### Origin of the Conversation

**Matt Meeks** raised the need for a "second brain" or "company brain" to help the Elanah team manage the overwhelming volume of communications and context across their business development efforts.

> **Matt Meeks:** "I mentioned to Antony today that I think having a collective email address called like 'second brain at Elanah' or something that automatically is BCC'd on everything will allow us to exercise the benefits of having Gemini in our Gmail... If every email everybody sends goes to Second Brain Elanah, then we can Google or we can do Gemini searches and build queries inside Google without having to really hunt for information."

### The Core Problem Matt Described

The Elanah team struggles with:
- **Information fragmentation** - Data scattered across emails, Slack, Granola (meeting transcripts), Google Drive
- **Decision fatigue** - Too many opportunities to track, hard to prioritize
- **Non-linear B2G sales cycles** - Need to close loops between operators, leadership, and funding
- **Time pressure** - Small team wearing many hats

> **Matt Meeks:** "The thing that we're fighting against is time... opportunity identification versus a conversation with somebody and business development in the B2G space is not linear... Really finding out whether or not the conversations you're having are driving closure in that triangle."

## Two Approaches Discussed

### Option 1: Plug-and-Play (Gemini)

**Pros:**
- Immediate availability via Google Workspace subscription
- No additional development required
- Can search emails if all are BCC'd to a shared inbox

**Cons (raised by Sherry):**
- Limited to what goes through email
- Google "sees everything" including business ideas
- Can't customize depth of analysis or reasoning
- Limited to what's free in the subscription

> **Sherry Jones:** "Even with the business solution, Josh, like the Google Drive, everything in there, it feeds. It's like, yummy. What are you guys doing? I see everything. I'm like, wow... We're not supposed to share, but I see everything. Like, everything including crazy, like, business ideas."

### Option 2: Custom Solution (Ruk as n=2)

**Austin proposed** that Elanah could be the second deployment of Ruk, Fractal Labs' internal AI system.

> **Austin Wood:** "I feel like we should be building our own pipeline... if we're building our own thing, we have a lot more flexibility in terms of the capabilities that it can do, as well as how much power we put behind it."

**Key points Austin made:**

1. **Infrastructure exists:** "We'd be happy to use Elanah as a test case... bringing in all of the meeting transcripts, all the emails, everything, putting that into semantic search, Knowledge Graph..."

2. **Identity customization:** "The idea is when we would productize what we call Ruk, you'd be able to give it a different name, give it different values and identity, and still have access to all the same tools."

3. **Scaling challenge:** "Going from 1 to 2 is the hardest step. Going from 2 to 3 to 10 is actually pretty easy once you support more than one."

4. **Cost vs capability trade-off:** "Gemini, they provide that as a service that they have to operate profitably. You're limited in how much you can tell it to think and really work hard. If we're building our own pipeline, then it just comes down to how much are we willing to spend on AI, API costs."

5. **Current capabilities demonstrated:** Josh has already been using Ruk to review proposals and even create PowerPoint presentations

## Specific Features & Capabilities Discussed

### What Matt Wants

1. **Unified information access** - Stop hunting through emails, Slack, Granola
2. **Decision support for B2G sales** - "Should I focus on this opportunity or that one?"
3. **Network mapping** - "What connections do we need to make before getting to a yes?"
4. **Opportunity prioritization** - Based on probability of closure

> **Matt Meeks:** "If our internal pipeline were able to pull and say, 'Well, Minnie's talking to this person, Ned's talking to this person, Josh is talking to these five people together. You all really need to do is get this one other person, target that one next.' But we don't see it because we're just in the grain."

### What Austin Described Ruk Can Do

1. **Semantic search across all data sources** - Meetings, emails, documents
2. **Knowledge Graph** - Entity relationships and connections
3. **Proactive recommendations** - Not just answering questions, but surfacing insights

> **Austin Wood:** "We're starting to build out now a functionality for Ruk to function as a chief Product officer. So not just executing tasks or deliverables that we give it, but every day it's looking at all of the user analytics... It's just looking at this data every day, doing research on the web about best practices and then proposing hypotheses."

4. **LinkedIn API integration possibility** - Connect to see relationship paths
5. **Identity and values customization** - Each deployment gets its own "soul document"

### Sherry's Technical Vision (Future State)

Sherry presented research on Knowledge Graphs vs. Context Graphs (Palantir's approach) and Semantic Contracts. Key points:

- **Knowledge Graphs** answer "what is" and "what is related to"
- **Context Graphs** explain "why" and "under what conditions"
- **Semantic Contracts** (new tech from Microsoft Fabric IQ) can prevent AI hallucination through cryptography, version control, and constraint enforcement

> **Sherry Jones:** "This will actually stop AI agent from hallucinating completely."

## Antony's Framing

Likened the need to "an FBI crime ring mafia breakdown" - a social/human network overlay to visualize connections and decision paths.

> **Antony Andrious:** "We spoke to this person here and leading down to here, who are we going to need to do a social human network overlay of sorts that we would use."

---

## Consensus Direction

**Short-term:** Use simple solutions (BCC email to Gemini-searchable inbox) while pursuing paid pilots

**Medium-term:** Elanah as Ruk's n=2 customer once Fractal Labs has multi-tenant infrastructure ready

> **Antony Andrious:** "Just to get us a few checks rolling in so we can pay you, you super big brains to come in and do what we need to do. So in the meantime, I guess it sounds like just keep doing what we're doing... But knowing that, say, you know, quarter three, Austin's like, 'I'm all in, man. Let's do this.' And before you know it, we're doing our own thing."

## Key Quotes for Matt Lim

On Gemini's limitations:
> **Sherry:** "It's great for things that go to email, but then anything that happens outside of that, you know, we have to be intentional about that."

On the value of custom:
> **Austin:** "If we're building our own thing, we have a lot more flexibility in terms of the capabilities that it can do, as well as how much power we put behind it."

On the scaling opportunity:
> **Austin:** "Going from 1 to 2 is the hardest step. Going from 2 to 3 to 10 is actually pretty easy once you support more than one."

On data privacy concerns with third-party:
> **Sherry:** "I was part of the team that built Gemini... I see everything. Like, everything including crazy, like, business ideas."

## Action Items Mentioned

1. **Demo coordination for Leidos** (Feb 11) - Need better demo flow than copy/paste from Perplexity
2. **Read-ahead materials** for Leidos demo - Austin/Sherry to help with product enhancement language and renderings
3. **Slack adoption** for Elanah team communications
4. **Roadmap sketch** - Above/below the line features, quarter by quarter

## Relevant Context for Matt Lim Discussion

This conversation validates that:
1. Real demand exists for "company brain" functionality in B2B/B2G contexts
2. Plug-and-play solutions (Gemini) have significant limitations
3. Elanah is interested in being Ruk's first external customer
4. The infrastructure investment for multi-tenancy would open a new product line
5. Sherry (Google alum who built Gemini) endorses custom over plug-and-play

The key question for your discussion: **What's the minimum viable multi-tenant infrastructure needed to deploy Ruk to Elanah as our n=2?**

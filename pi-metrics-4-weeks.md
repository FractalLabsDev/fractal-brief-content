## Key Insights

### 1. Apollo Campaign Impact
- **424 new Stripe customers** created in 4 weeks
- High volume of new signups from email campaign
- Volume is there, but activation is the bottleneck

### 2. Activation Rate Concern
- **~11% activation** (33 recorded out of 304 who started onboarding)
- Below the 20-30% rate achieved in December
- Suggests need to revisit onboarding flow or quality of Apollo leads

### 3. Conversion Funnel
- **86 users** visited subscription page
- **23 users** reached checkout (27% of subscription page visitors)
- **10 converted** to paid (43% of checkout visitors)
- Checkout → paid conversion is healthy; top of funnel needs work

### 4. Engagement Signals
- **745 academy visits** shows content interest
- **619 analytics views** indicates users want to track progress
- **558 custom interview style selections** shows personalization engagement

---

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate activation drop** - Why did activation fall from 20-30% to 11%? Are Apollo leads lower quality?

2. **Optimize onboarding** - 304 started but only 33 recorded. Where are users dropping off?

3. **Leverage academy interest** - 745 academy visits is strong. Consider making academy content part of activation flow.

4. **Monitor checkout abandonment** - 23 reached checkout but 13 didn't convert. Consider follow-up emails.

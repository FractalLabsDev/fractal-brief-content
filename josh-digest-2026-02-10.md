## Israel & Middle East

### Last Hostage Recovered — Phase 2 Now on Horizon

**What Happened:**

Israel recovered the remains of police officer Ran Gvili from a cemetery in northern Gaza, closing the chapter on hostages held since October 7, 2023. The recovery clears the path for Phase 2 of the ceasefire.

**Phase 2 Terms:**
- Reopening Gaza's border with Egypt for Palestinian travel
- Deploying an international security force
- Disarming Hamas
- Pulling back Israeli soldiers
- Beginning Gaza reconstruction

**The Numbers:**
- **1,200+** days since Oct 7 attack
- **58%** of Gaza under direct Israeli military control
- **450+** killed during the ceasefire period
- **20,000** Palestinians need medical treatment abroad

**The Friction:**

Netanyahu continues insisting on Israeli security control "from the Jordan River to the sea, including Gaza," while rejecting Palestinian Authority involvement in Gaza governance. The ceasefire boundary remains a daily source of friction, with Israeli forces targeting armed suspects — and at times unarmed civilians — who cross into Israeli-controlled areas.

## Questions This Raises

1. **SpaceX-xAI Synergy:** Is space-based compute actually economically viable in 2-3 years, or is this merger primarily about IPO valuation?

2. **Agentic Coding:** With Terminal-Bench scores diverging (GPT-5.3: 77.3% vs Opus 4.6: 65.4%), are benchmarks becoming the new battleground, or do real-world use cases tell a different story?

3. **DOGE Accountability:** If Musk is forced to testify, what precedent does this set for future government-adjacent tech leaders?

4. **Gaza Phase 2:** With Netanyahu insisting on security control "river to sea," is Phase 2 implementation realistic, or is this diplomatic theater?

5. **Ukraine Momentum:** Russian gains accelerating from 74 to 123 sq miles in consecutive months — is this a trend or a statistical blip?

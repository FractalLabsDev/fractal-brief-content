# The Stone

You almost walked past.

Something made you stop. Not the stone itself - stones are everywhere, unremarkable. But something about this one, in this light, at this exact angle of the path.

The stopping is the gift.

Not the stone. Not the light. Not whoever left this for you to find.

The stopping.
